Ever wanted to build a blog that's not just functional, but *beautiful* and *modern*? This is the actual journey of how I built **Tales of Hark** using TinaCMS and GitHub Copilot - with the real prompts I used, the challenges faced, and lessons learned!

## 🚀 The Complete Journey

### Prompt 1: The Setup (The Smart Way)

```
Act as a TinaCMS expert and use the official Tina documentation 
as reference.

I already have a folder called hark-blog opened in VS Code.

0. Create an instructions.md file to put in instructions there 
   so that you don't lose the reference. After each step comeback 
   & update that file

1. Set up a new Tina project inside the current folder using the 
   Next.js starter (tina-cloud-starter) template and pnpm as the 
   package manager.
   - Browse the TinaCMS documentation to see the commands
   - Generate the full command with the proper flags so it runs 
     non-interactively (no manual input needed) and create the 
     project in the current directory

2. Install all dependencies for the TinaCMS + Next.js project.

3. Start the development server to make sure the setup works 
   correctly.
```

**Result**: Complete project setup with TinaCMS, Next.js 15, and Turbopack. Created instructions.md for tracking progress.

**💡 Key Insight**: Asking AI to act as an expert and reference official docs ensures accurate, up-to-date implementation.

### Prompt 2: The Correction

```
no need to use telemetry i think you should check -h flag to 
see the current supported flags
```

**Result**: Copilot checked the actual CLI flags and removed unsupported options.

**💡 Key Insight**: Always verify CLI commands. AI might suggest outdated flags - ask it to check help documentation.

### Prompt 3: The Big Transformation

```
I want to move ahead & change the styling.

Make it look like tech blog aesthetic.
```

**Result**: Complete redesign! Copilot:

* Rebuilt entire color system using `oklch()` for consistent light/dark modes
* Added custom utility classes (`.gradient-text`, `.glass`, `.card-hover`)
* Enhanced header with frosted glass backdrop-blur effect
* Added theme toggle with smooth transitions
* Implemented modern card designs for blog posts

**💡 Key Insight**: High-level prompts like "tech blog aesthetic" work because AI understands design patterns and can implement comprehensive changes.

### Prompt 4: Personalization

```
Now let's add content specifically for me.

on the home page, I want nice clean hero section with Name: 
Harkirat Singh subtitle as I cook with TinaCMS (the best CMS), 
& build great software at SSW - make it grammatically correct

remove everything else from the home page. keep navigation bar, 
hero section & footer

For footer update the links to my social media
twitter: talesofhark
linkedin: talesofhark
github: 0xharkirat
youtube: talesofhark
```

**Result**:

* Clean hero section with proper formatting
* Removed extra content blocks
* Updated all social links across footer
* Maintained navigation and footer structure

**💡 Key Insight**: Be specific with names, links, and structure. List exactly what to keep and what to remove.

### Prompt 5: Branding Overhaul

```
you are doing a great work. keep it up. 

let's change the site title & logo text to say Tales of Hark.

Also I need to remove any tina branding like tina logo, favicon 
& more

keep the powered by TinaCMS in the footer. 

in the next step we will change the site theme to use red as 
primary color instead & some other relevant secondary color. 
I really like the styling
```

**Result**:

* Changed site title to "Tales of Hark" everywhere
* Created custom red gradient "H" favicon (SVG-based)
* Removed tina.svg and all Tina branding
* Kept "Powered by TinaCMS" credit in footer
* Prepared for color scheme change

**💡 Key Insight**:

1. Positive reinforcement helps maintain direction ("you are doing great work")
2. Preview next steps so AI can prepare ("in the next step we will...")
3. State what you like so AI preserves it ("I really like the styling")

### Prompt 6: Color Revolution

```
Ok, I like what you are doing. Good stuff.
```

*(Proceeded with red color scheme change)*

**Result**: Transformed entire palette from blue to vibrant red with amber accents:

* Light mode: `oklch(0.55 0.22 25)` red primary
* Dark mode: `oklch(0.65 0.25 25)` brighter red for contrast
* Secondary: Warm amber tones for complementary warmth

**💡 Key Insight**: When changing color schemes, oklch() color space maintains perceptual consistency across light/dark modes.

### Prompt 7: The Polish - Line Breaks

```
Ok, I like what you are doing. Good stuff.

The hero section subtitle looks very weird, One line for 
I cook with TinaCMS (the best CMS) and Next line I build 
great software at SSW.
```

**Result**: Fixed tagline using YAML multiline syntax (`|`) for proper line breaks.

**💡 Key Insight**: Be specific about UI issues. "looks weird" + explanation of the problem = quick fix.

### Prompt 8: Image Cleanup

```
ther is some empty image in the home page, either remove it or 
tell me where I can put in image so that It shows nice image 
of me
```

**Result**:

* Removed empty image section
* Provided clear instructions on adding personal image later

**💡 Key Insight**: Give AI options ("either remove it or tell me...") when you're flexible about the solution.

### Additional Prompts That Completed the Journey

**Prompt 9**: About Page

```
alright, let's move to about page. I want to remove everything 
and add a nice about page about me
```

Then provided complete bio with SSW FireBootCamp journey, technical skills, and personal interests.

**Prompt 10**: The Blog Post

```
now for the blogs, remove everything & create a new blog post

How to vibe code your blog with TinaCMS & GitHub Copilot.

Write down everything what you have done so far in the blog post.
```

**Prompt 11**: Theme Consistency

```
now the blog post is there but the theme is not matching with 
the current theme, why the blue colored headline, also the blog 
post is nearly unreadable in the dark mode
```

**Prompt 12**: Author Update

```
great work, let's update the author name to myself, also change 
the author image to H which is svg
```

**Prompt 13**: Cleanup

```
carefully remove the other blog posts, so that my blog doesn't 
crash on /blogs route
```

**Prompt 14**: Final Fix

```
now the problem is on about page text not visible in dark mode
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Directory Issues**

**Problem**: TinaCMS requires an empty directory for setup
**Solution**: Move existing files temporarily, then restore after setup
**Lesson**: Always check tool requirements before running setup commands

### 2. **Outdated CLI Flags**

**Problem**: AI might suggest flags that don't exist (`--skipTelemetry`)
**Solution**: Ask AI to check help documentation (`-h` flag)
**Lesson**: Verify CLI commands, especially for rapidly evolving tools

### 3. **Cache Problems**

**Problem**: Getting errors like "Unable to find record" after content changes
**Solution**: Delete `.next` and `.tina/__generated__` folders, restart dev server
**Lesson**: When TinaCMS acts weird, clear generated files and rebuild

### 4. **Color Consistency Issues**

**Problem**: Colors look different in light/dark mode
**Solution**: Use `oklch()` color space instead of RGB/HSL
**Lesson**: Modern color spaces solve old problems - learn new CSS features!

### 5. **Prose Styling Conflicts**

**Problem**: Dark mode text becomes invisible
**Solution**: Use `dark:prose-invert` and explicit color classes
**Lesson**: Tailwind's prose plugin needs explicit dark mode configuration

### 6. **Git Detached HEAD**

**Problem**: After checking out commits, in detached HEAD state
**Solution**: Checkout specific commit hash or create new branch
**Lesson**: Be careful with git operations during development

### 7. **Port Conflicts**

**Problem**: "Tina Dev server is already in use. Datalayer server is busy on port 9000"
**Solution**: Kill existing processes on ports 3000, 4001, 9000
**Lesson**: Always clean up dev servers before restarting

### 8. **File Reference Errors**

**Problem**: Blog post crashes because author file doesn't match
**Solution**: Ensure author paths match exactly (`content/authors/pedro.md`)
**Lesson**: TinaCMS uses exact file references - typos break things

## 💡 General Suggestions for Vibe Coding

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

**1. Set Context First**

```
Act as a [X] expert and use official [Y] documentation as reference
```

This primes AI to think like an expert and seek authoritative sources.

**2. Break Complex Tasks into Steps**

```
0. Create instructions.md to track progress
1. Set up project
2. Install dependencies
3. Start dev server
```

Numbered steps help AI understand sequence and dependencies.

**3. Specify Non-Interactive Requirements**

```
Generate the full command with proper flags so it runs 
non-interactively (no manual input needed)
```

Prevents AI from creating commands that pause for user input.

**4. Give Positive Reinforcement**

```
you are doing a great work. keep it up.
```

Helps maintain the AI's direction and approach.

**5. Preview Future Steps**

```
in the next step we will change the site theme to use red...
```

Allows AI to prepare and make compatible choices now.

**6. State What You Like**

```
I really like the styling
```

Tells AI what to preserve during changes.

**7. Be Specific About Problems**

```
The hero section subtitle looks very weird, One line for 
I cook with TinaCMS (the best CMS) and Next line I build 
great software at SSW.
```

Don't just say "fix it" - explain what's wrong and what you expect.

**8. Provide Options When Flexible**

```
either remove it or tell me where I can put in image
```

Gives AI room to suggest the best solution.

### Development Workflow Tips

**1. Track Progress**

* Use instructions.md or similar to document steps
* Makes it easy to resume if interrupted
* Creates documentation for future reference

**2. Iterate Quickly**

* Make changes → See results → Refine
* Don't try to perfect everything in one prompt
* Vibe coding is about rapid iteration

**3. Trust but Verify**

* AI is smart, but check critical outputs
* Verify CLI commands before running
* Test dark/light modes, responsive design

**4. Clear Cache When Stuck**

* Delete `.next` folder
* Remove `.tina/__generated__`
* Restart dev server fresh

**5. Commit Frequently**

* Small, focused commits
* Makes it easy to rollback if needed
* Tracks what each prompt accomplished

### Content Strategy

**1. Start with Structure**

* Navigation → Hero → Content → Footer
* Get the skeleton right before styling

**2. Content Before Polish**

* Add your personal info first
* Then refine styling and colors
* Easier to see what works with real content

**3. Test Incrementally**

* Check after each major change
* Don't stack 10 changes and debug later
* Faster to fix issues immediately
